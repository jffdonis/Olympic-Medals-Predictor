# Olympic Medal Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning program that utilizes linear regression to predict the number of medals a country's team is likely to receive in the Summer Olympics. The program analyzes historical data from the Olympic results spanning from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016, focusing exclusively on the Summer Olympics.

By employing linear regression techniques, this program aims to provide insights into the factors that contribute to a country's success in the Olympic Games. It takes into account various features such as participant count per country, event types, and previous amount of medals per country to generate predictions for future medal counts.

## Key Features

* Utilizes linear regression for Olympic medal prediction.
* Developed in Python, leveraging the scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib libraries.
* Provides insights into the factors influencing a country's medal count.
* Analyzes historical data from the Summer Olympics spanning from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016.

## Data 

The original data was taking from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results).
However only the Summer data was used and the variables were narrowed down to not include specific information of athletes. 

## Installation

The project need the following requirements to be installed locally:

* Python 3.8+
* Python packages
    * pandas
    * numpy
    * scikit-learn
    * seaborn
